# Dice-Rolling-Simulator

### The Goal: Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice.

1. When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6. (Or whatever other integer you prefer — the number of sides on the die is up to you.)

2. The program will show a dice picture of what that number is. It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again.

3. For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6.

4. You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number within that range and chooses from a list if image urls to display.

## Concepts to keep in mind:

* TKInter
* Random
* Integer
* List
* While Loops

## Provided to you:
* 6 dice images
* A logo image for you app
* A background image for you app screen
* An icon for you app (you'll need this incase you export your program as an executable file (.exe))
